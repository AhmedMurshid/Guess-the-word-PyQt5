# Guess-the-word

Hello , I created this project with python PyQt5 library. 

This project is a word guessing game, and depending on the answer the background changes color.  each part is textbox(QLine) or button

I created a list of word that are randomly picked , and the user keeps guessing the words from the list.

The purpose of the project was to understand pyqt5 and play around. I started 1pm and around 5pm I got that much done, so let me know how i did and what I can improve on.

(working progress:)
